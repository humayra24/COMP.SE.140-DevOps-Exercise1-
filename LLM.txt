Motivation to use LLM 

I have used Node.js for this assignment. I knew the basics but I am not that comfortable with Node.js. So, I used LLM to code more efficiently and not to waste time by sticking on an unknown error.

How and why LLM helped 

LLM helped me with the topics that I was confused about. It also helped to find errors and debug the errors. And it was a good learning experience, my confusions regarding networking, persistent volumes got cleared. 
 
Mistakes by LLM 

I did not get the required response and LLM provided completely wrong answers many times. The reason for this might be the bad prompting. 

What were things that LLM was not able to provide 

I think because of bad prompting, I could not get the correct response. Otherwise, I think nowadays, LLMs are quite efficient.
